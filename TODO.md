- rework command error handling

- rework channels to also be handled by id everywhere

- maybe make an Erdos number implementation by watching who referenced by whom in channels?

- think about -> document the scope of each command
    - ie. if a command takes into account other channels / can access data from other channels, ... 
    - (it is currently a goulash)
