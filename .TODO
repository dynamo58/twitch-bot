âœ” rework channels to also be handled by id everywhere @done(22-04-13 05:23)
- make a function to parse channel name, channel id, user, user_id and user_name, so it's not all over the place in the actual command bodies 
- rework command error handling
- maybe make an Erdos number implementation by watching who referenced by whom in channels?
- think about -> document the scope of each command
    - ie. if a command takes into account other channels / can access data from other channels, ... 
    - (it is currently a goulash)
